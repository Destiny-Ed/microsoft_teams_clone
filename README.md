Microsoft Teams Clone is a Video conference application with a rich integrated chat experience, to connect with friends,family & colleagues.
Developed as a redesign of Microsoft Teams during my menteeship at [Microsoft Engage 2021](https://microsoft.acehacker.com/engage2021/index.html),
It implements the following features of the original app 
  * [Instant Messaging](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-teams/instant-messaging)    
    Share your opinion and have fun with your team. Send GIFs, stickers, and emojis in a group chat or in one-to-one messages.
  * [Online Meetings](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-teams/online-meetings)    
    Instantly go from group chat to video conference with the touch of a button.
  * [Collaborate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-teams/online-meetings)    
    Easily find, share files in real time, in chat to keep the work on :)

This application is written using Flutter & Dart, It leverages Gradle and AndroidX and utilises StreamChat SDK ,Google Firebase and Jisi Meet Android SDK.
